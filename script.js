// ! Development Guidelines
//? Define the core mechanics: the bird’s movement (flap, gravity, drop)
// Craft a responsive “flap” mechanism using event listeners to modify the bird’s velocity and simulate jumps.
//? precise collision detection logic to determine when the bird touches obstacles or the canvas boundaries.
// * Position of the bird is always centered

// ? Integrate keyboard (space bar) touch events (mobile)
// Provide immediate visual and audio feedback for events (collision, and game-over transitions)

// Use OOP
// Ensure encapsulation for maintainability.

// t Set up an HTML5 <canvas> for drawing and animation
// Initializing the 2D rendering context for smoother graphics.
// ? Manage the animation loop with requestAnimationFrame to ensure consistent frame rates and performance

//? obstacle generation (pipes) with varying gaps and positions. (increase difficulty as score increases)
// Design an algorithm to generate and recycle pipes dynamically.
// Implement a scoring system.

// ! Testing
//Verify transitions between game states (start, playing, game over, restart) occur correctly.

//Test that gravity, velocity, and the flap mechanism produce expected position changes.
//Test that event listeners correctly respond to user input, triggering the flap action reliably.

//Ensure the animation loop consistently invokes requestAnimationFrame without performance lag.
//Check behavior when the bird nearly touches obstacles or screen boundaries to ensure correct detection
//verify that score resets and state transitions are robust.

//persistent high scores using local storage

// use image() onload event and call drawimage()
